# [A Basic Javascript Portfolio ](https://avaarm.github.io/Updated-Portfolio-Page-1/)


## About

This is a front-end/client-side JavaScript application utilizing mobile-friendly, responsive design. JavaScript is a widely used scripting language that adds functionality and interactivity to a webpage. Building on a static HTML framework and CSS styling, with JavaScript we can store information in variables, manipulate your HTML, respond to an event, play audio and video, etc.

I went a step further and used jQuery, which is a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling. It allows us to write fewer lines of code than if we were using plain old JavaScript. jQuery also provides a number of methods for animations and working with APIs.
